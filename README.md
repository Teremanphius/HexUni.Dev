### Info :
Yes, I did use code from other peoples hubs and such but thats due to the fact I wanted to make a all-in-one script of fun stuff, <strong>credits are listed</strong>. (Make an issue if i missed a credit and for you to be credited)
And no this is not skidded because <strong>I'm willing to give credit</strong>.

Furthermore I might not be upkeeping this hub so you know.

List bugs in issues and also if you execute twice something may not work due to my ass coding.
